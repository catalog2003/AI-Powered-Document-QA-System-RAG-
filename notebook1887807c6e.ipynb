Will he ever return? It may be that he swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians,\ngarden opened, and the man-servant appeared. We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. ‘Has Mr.— gone out that way?’ said I. ‘No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to ﬁnd him here.’ At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows\nat the dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of the ‘ingenious paradox and trick’ we had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it ﬁrst. ‘Hallo!’ I said. ‘At last!’ And the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. ‘Good heavens! man, what’s the matter?’\nwhen that is put together I mean to have a journey on my own account.’ ‘You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?’ said Filby. ‘Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.’ After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. ‘It must have gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,’ he said. ‘Why?’ said the Time Traveller. ‘Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must have travelled through 10 CHAPTER\nTime Traveller did not seem to hear. ‘Don’t let me disturb you,’ he said, with a certain faltering articulation. ‘I’m all right.’ He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it oﬀat a draught. ‘That’s good,’ he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance ﬂickered over our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. ‘I’m going to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things.\ntiality, turning towards the Time Traveller. ‘Not a bit,’ said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: ‘You think. You can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold, you know, diluted presentation.’ ‘Of course,’ said the Psychologist, and reassured us. ‘That’s a simple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel spinning, or a bullet ﬂying through the air. If it is travelling through time ﬁfty times or a hundred times\nI came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. ‘I’m frightfully busy,’ said he, ‘with that thing in there.’ ‘But is it not some hoax?’ I said. ‘Do you really travel through time?’ ‘Really and truly I do.’ And he looked frankly into my eyes. He hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. ‘I only want half an hour,’ he said. ‘I\nmove about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about in Time.’ ‘That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground.

Of course we have no means of staying back for any length of time, any more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a civilised man is better oﬀthan the savage in this respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?’ ‘Oh, this,’ began\nglanced now and again at each other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller’s face. Chapter 3 ‘I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s sound enough.

The door from the corridor opens slowly and silently, and he stands before them. The narrator's immediate reaction is one of surprise and concern, exclaiming, \"Good heavens! man, what’s the matter?\" This suggests the Time Traveller's appearance or demeanor is unusual.\n\nImmediately after his arrival:\n*   He is described as having \"faltering articulation\" when he speaks, but he assures them, \"I’m all right.\"\n*   He swiftly holds out his glass for more drink and takes it off \"at a draught,\" indicating a strong need for refreshment or a return to composure.\n*   Following the drink, his \"eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came into his cheeks,\" suggesting a revitalization.\n*   His glance \"flickered over our faces with a certain dull approval\" and then swept around the \"warm and comfortable room,\" as if reorienting himself or observing his surroundings after an absence.\n*   He speaks again, still \"feeling his way among his words,\" before announcing his intention to \"wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things.\"\n*   He is later seen with \"a small camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other,\" implying he has brought back items from his travels.\n*   His time machine itself, when inspected, is found to be \"a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent,\" though \"the rest of it’s sound enough.\"\n*   He frankly confirms to the narrator that he \"really and truly\" travels through time.\n\n**Upon his ultimate, permanent stop (disappearance):**\n\nThe text also describes a final, more definitive \"stop\" for the Time Traveller, which is his permanent vanishing. It is stated that \"The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows now, he has never returned.\" This \"stop\" is characterized by:\n*   His complete and mysterious absence, leaving behind a profound sense of wonder and uncertainty.\n*   The narrator's fear that he \"must wait a lifetime\" for his return.\n*   Speculation among others about where he might have gone, with theories ranging from sweeping \"back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone\" to landing \"into the abysses of the Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians.\"\n\nIn essence, when the Time Traveller stops, he either returns in a visibly altered state, requiring a period of recovery and explanation, or he simply disappears, leaving his companions in perpetual wonder and uncertainty about his fate.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":34},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
